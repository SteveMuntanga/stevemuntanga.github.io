	<div id="What-I-Do"><h3>What I Do</h3>
<p>I am an entrepreneur and Freelancer. My freelancing work involves web development, Search Engine Optimization(SEO) and Graphics Design. As you may be thinking, I'm most interested in visual aspects of technology. In my free time, I do Printed Circuit Board(PCB) design; only for the fun of it.</p><p>When it comes to entrepreneurship, I run a mobile phone business <a href="https://facebook.com/winamobile">Wina Mobile</a> specializing in mobile and mobile phone accessories retail.

	<div id="Why-Hire-Me"><h3>Why Hire Me</h3>
<p>I believe every client deserves quality results from a freelancer. I put my best in building websites and flier/logo design. I only allow my clients pay 50% down payment(refundable) of the total amount for each project. The rest, 50%, is paid after the project is completed and the client is satisfied with the work.</p>
<p>I take my time during development and design to avoid mistakes that can cost both me as a freelancer and clients. And if a client finds an error or mistake later, they're always welcome for corrections with zero charges.</p>
<p>I believe this is what makes my clients to to stick with me and recommend me to others. I believe this what you want too.</p></div>
